Copy the files in the server folder to a system with node installed and is accesible by the computer that the HMM Ant+ 
module can access. 

Repoint Users/username/AppData/roaming/hFon_Gateway/etc/app.xml to your server.

On server: sudo node index.js

Test by taking a reading from a hmm device, hmm gateway should register the reading.

To read from the server install the driver in webinos-driver-manager and start dashboard. You should now be able to drag
and drop a new sensor(uses hrm symbol) onto a graph.
